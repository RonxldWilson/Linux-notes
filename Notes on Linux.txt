Ways to access a Linux System
1. Console
2. Remote - Need the IP address to connect remotely

If you want to connect to Linux machine via windows remotely you will need to connect via Putty Client on windows 
This connection is done via CLI

You can connect Via SSH if WIN 10 is the OS which is used for the opertion


## What is files System?

## File System in Linux

/boot - files that is used by the boot loader
/root root user home dir
/dev System devices 
/etc Confoig files
/bin -> /usr/bin - Everyday user commands
/sbin -> /usr/bin - Systme filesystem commands
/opt - Optional
/proc Running Processs
/lib - C programming lib files need by commands
/tmp - Dir for temp files
/home - dir for user
/var - System logs
/run - Systen daemons that start very early to store runtime files like PID files
/mnt To mount external filesystem
/media For cdrom mounts

### Commands for Traversing the File System

pwd
cd
ls -l 

#Linux File properties

# of links - Number of Hard links to the file. 
    For a hard link the # of hard links is the number of immediate subdirectories it has plus it's parent directory and itself


#Linux File Types

- = Regular File
d = directory
l = Link
c = Special file or Device file
s = socket
p = Named Pipe
b = block device


What is Root?

There are three types of root on Linux Systme
1. Root Account
2. Root as /: the very first directory in Linux is also refferred as root dir
3. Root home directory: the root ujser account also has a directory located in /root whihc is called root home directory

## Changing password = passwd userid


#File System paths

there are two types of paths:
    -   absolute path
    -   relative path

cd /var/log/samba

or cd var   
    cd log
    cd samba

## Creating Files and directories
    -   touch   Empty file 
    -   cp  Copying an existing file 
    -   vi  creating file using editor

Creating dir
    -   mkdir

-> ls -ltr - to list the files and order them in a timely manner

-> To exit VIM use :wq!

To Copy a directory use the cp command with -R option for recursuve and specify the source
and destination directories to be opened

cp -R <source folder> <destination folder>

To find a file use -"find" and "locate"

-> find . -name "<name of the file>" = . means start from the current location
-> find / -anme "<name of the file>"  = use this command to search from a particular repository

# Diffrence between find and locate
    -   Locate uses DB to find the file
        -   Need to run updatedb if the the DB is not updated
    -   Find iterates over the filesystem to locate the files

Locate is faster than the Find command

## wildcard
* - zero or more characters
? - represents a single character
[]  - represents a range of characters 

-> touch abc{1..9}-xyz = this will create the files from 1 to 9

## Hard Links and Soft Links

inode = Pointer or a number of a file on the hard disks

Soft Link = Link will be removed if the file is removed or renamed
Hard Link = Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link

Command: ln     = for hard link 
         ln -s  = for soft link

It's not possible to create a hard or soft link within the same directory, the links need to be made in the diffrent directory

Command: cat   = for viewing the file 
Command: echo  = for writing to the file

Hard links work within the same partiion

The rm command to remove the file doesn't remove the source of the file, it just removes the link to the file

Command: passwd username = to change the password of a user

Linux file system types: xfs, ext2, ext3
windows file System types: NTFS 


Command: ls -ltri = Lists the inodes of the file 

# Command Syntax
    Command Option arguments

    Options: Modify the way that a command works
    usually consist of a hyphen or a dash followed by a single letter
    some commands accept multiple options which can be grouped together

    Arguments: Most command are uswed with one arguments
    Some commands assume a default commadn if none is supplied
    Argumetns are optional for some commands but required for others

#### File Permissions
    UNIX is a multi-user system. Every file and directory in your account can be protected
    from or made accessible to other users by changing its access permissions. Every user has
    responsibility for controlling access to their files.
    -   Permissions for a file or directory may be restricted to by types
    -   There are 3 type of permissions
            r -read
            w- write
            x - execute running a program
    -   Each permission (rwx) can be controlled at three levels
            u- user yourself
            g - group can be people in the same project
            o - other = everyone on the system
    - File or Directory permission can be displayed by running ls -I command
        -rwx rwx rwx
    Command to change permission.
        -   chmod

Command: man <command> = Manual of the command 

Command chmod g-w <filename>    =   This removes the write access to the file for the group
        chmod a-r <filename>    =   This removes the read access to the file for everyone 
        chmod u-r <filename>    =   This removes the read access from the user

        chmod u+rw <filename>   = This gives the user read and write access  
        chmod ugo+r <filename>   = This gives the user read access  

 if you remove the x access from a directory then you wont be able to access the directory and open it



Table for numerical assigning access

Numebr      Permission Type     Symbol
0           No Permission       -
1           Execute             -x
2           Write               -w-
3           Execute+Write       -wx
4           Read                r--
5           Read+Execute        r-x
6           Read+Write          rw-
7           Read+Write+Execute  rwx

Ex: chmod 764 <filename>
    This gives the access as rwx to the user, rw to the group and read to all others
