Ways to access a Linux System
1. Console
2. Remote - Need the IP address to connect remotely

If you want to connect to Linux machine via windows remotely you will need to connect via Putty Client on windows 
This connection is done via CLI

You can connect Via SSH if WIN 10 is the OS which is used for the opertion


## What is files System?

## File System in Linux

/boot - files that is used by the boot loader
/root root user home dir
/dev System devices 
/etc Confoig files
/bin -> /usr/bin - Everyday user commands
/sbin -> /usr/bin - Systme filesystem commands
/opt - Optional
/proc Running Processs
/lib - C programming lib files need by commands
/tmp - Dir for temp files
/home - dir for user
/var - System logs
/run - Systen daemons that start very early to store runtime files like PID files
/mnt To mount external filesystem
/media For cdrom mounts

### Commands for Traversing the File System

pwd
cd
ls -l 

#Linux File properties

# of links - Number of Hard links to the file. 
    For a hard link the # of hard links is the number of immediate subdirectories it has plus it's parent directory and itself


#Linux File Types

- = Regular File
d = directory
l = Link
c = Special file or Device file
s = socket
p = Named Pipe
b = block device


What is Root?

There are three types of root on Linux Systme
1. Root Account
2. Root as /: the very first directory in Linux is also refferred as root dir
3. Root home directory: the root ujser account also has a directory located in /root whihc is called root home directory

## Changing password = passwd userid


#File System paths

there are two types of paths:
    -   absolute path
    -   relative path

cd /var/log/samba

or cd var   
    cd log
    cd samba

## Creating Files and directories
    -   touch   Empty file 
    -   cp  Copying an existing file 
    -   vi  creating file using editor

Creating dir
    -   mkdir

-> ls -ltr - to list the files and order them in a timely manner

-> To exit VIM use :wq!

To Copy a directory use the cp command with -R option for recursuve and specify the source
and destination directories to be opened

cp -R <source folder> <destination folder>

To find a file use -"find" and "locate"

-> find . -name "<name of the file>" = . means start from the current location
-> find / -anme "<name of the file>"  = use this command to search from a particular repository

# Diffrence between find and locate
    -   Locate uses DB to find the file
        -   Need to run updatedb if the the DB is not updated
    -   Find iterates over the filesystem to locate the files

Locate is faster than the Find command

## wildcard
* - zero or more characters
? - represents a single character
[]  - represents a range of characters 

-> touch abc{1..9}-xyz = this will create the files from 1 to 9

## Hard Links and Soft Links

inode = Pointer or a number of a file on the hard disks
